The main steps to solve the eigen problems are:
 1) Define your medium (elastic properties, layers/gradients, general)
    make your own code and respect the medium structure
      
 2) Define your time / frequency domain
 3) Definte your sampling scheme (recursive or simply linear)
 3) Solve the eigen problem

The applications of the eigen functions may be:
 + Dispersion curves
 + Horizontal-Vertical (HV) ratios
 + The surface-wave Green's functions
 + The surface-wave response to a single force point source
 + The surface-wave response to a double couple point source
